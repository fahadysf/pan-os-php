ISSUE: â
INFO: If you use Panorama to retrieve logs from Strata Logging Service, new log fields (including for Device-ID, Decryption, and GlobalProtect) are not visible on the Panorama web interface.Workaround: Enable duplicate logging to send the logs to Strata Logging Service and Panorama. This workaround does not support Panorama virtual appliances in Management Only mode.

ISSUE: PLUG-380
INFO: When you rename a device group, template, or template stack in Panorama that is part of a VMware NSX service definition, the new name is not reflected in NSX Manager. Therefore, any ESXi hosts that you add to a vSphere cluster are not added to the correct device group, template, or template stack and your Security policy is not pushed to VM-Series firewalls that you deploy after you rename those objects. There is no impact to existing VM-Series firewalls.

ISSUE: PAN-264281
INFO:  When upgrading a ZTP firewall from PAN-OS 10.1 to PAN-OS 11.1 or later versions, if you use the To SW Version column to specify the target PAN-OS version, the upgrade process downloads and installs the intermediary base version containing an expired root certificate. This causes the ZTP firewall to lose connection with Panorama Workaround: Follow the standard upgrade process from Panorama, which you use for non-ZTP firewalls, to upgrade to the target PAN-OS version that contains the valid root certificate.

ISSUE: PAN-201855
INFO:  On the Panorama management server, cloning any template (PanoramaTemplates) corrupts certificates (DeviceCertificate ManagementCertificates) with the Block Private Key Export setting enabled across all templates. This results in managed firewalls experiencing issues wherever the corrupted certificate is referenced. For example, you have template A, B, and C where templates A and B have certificates with the Block Private Key Export setting enabled. Cloning template C corrupts the certificates with Block Private Key Export setting enabled in templates A and B. Workaround: After cloning a template, delete and re-import the corrupted certificates.

ISSUE: PAN-197341
INFO: On the Panorama management server, if you create multiple device group Objects with the same name in the Shared device group and any additional device groups (PanoramaDevice Groups) under the same device group hierarchy that are used in one or more Policies, renaming the object with a shared name in any device group causes the object name to change in the policies where it is used. This issue applies only to device group objects that can be referenced in a Security policy rule.For example:You create a parent device group DG-A and a child device group DG-B.You create address objects called AddressObjA in the Shared, DG-A and DG-B device groups and add AddressObjA to a Security policy rule under DG-A and DG-B.Later, you change the AddressObjA name in the Shared device group to AddressObjB.Changing the name of the address object in the Shared device group causes the references in the Policy rule to use the renamed Shared object instead of the device group object.

ISSUE: PAN-151085
INFO: On a PA-7000 Series firewall chassis having multiple slots, when HA clustering is enabled on an active/active HA pair, the session table count for one of the peers can show a higher count than the actual number of active sessions on that peer. This behavior can be seen when the session is being set up on a non-cache slot (for example, when a session distribution policy is set to round-robin or session-load); it is caused by the additional cache lookup that happens when HA cluster participation is enabled.

ISSUE: PAN-114495
INFO: Alibaba Cloud runs on a KVM hypervisor and supports two Virtio modes: DPDK (default) and MMAP. If you deploy a VM-Series firewall running PAN-OS 9.0 in DPDK packet mode and you then switch to MMAP packet mode, the VM-Series firewall duplicates packets that originate from or terminate on the firewall. As an example, if a load balancer or a server behind the firewall pings the VM-Series firewall after you switch from DPDK packet mode to MMAP packet mode, the firewall duplicates the ping packets.Throughput traffic is not duplicated if you deploy the VM-Series firewall using MMAP packet mode.

INFO: In WildFire appliance clusters that have three or more nodes, the Panorama management server does not support changing node roles. In a three-node cluster for example, you cannot use Panorama to configure the worker node as a controller node by adding the HA and cluster controller configurations, configure an existing controller node as a worker node by removing the HA configuration, and then commit and push the configuration. Attempts to change cluster node roles from Panorama results in a validation errorâthe commit fails and the cluster becomes unresponsive.

ISSUE: PAN-73401
INFO: When you import a two-node WildFire appliance cluster into the Panorama management server, the controller nodes report their state as out-of-sync if either of the following conditions exist:You did not configure a worker list to add at least one worker node to the cluster. (In a two-node cluster, both nodes are controller nodes configured as an HA pair. Adding a worker node would make the cluster a three-node cluster.)You did not configure a service advertisement (either by enabling or not enabling advertising DNS service on the controller nodes).Workaround: There are three possible workarounds to sync the controller nodes:After you import the two-node cluster into Panorama, push the configuration from Panorama to the cluster. After the push succeeds, Panorama reports that the controller nodes are in sync.Configure a worker list on the cluster controller:admin@wf500(active-controller)# set deviceconfig cluster mode controller worker-list <worker-ip-address>(<worker-ip-address> is the IP address of the worker node you are adding to the cluster.) This creates a three-node cluster. After you import the cluster into Panorama, Panorama reports that the controller nodes are in sync. When you want the cluster to have only two nodes, use a different workaround.Configure service advertisement on the local CLI of the cluster controller and then import the configuration into Panorama. The service advertisement can advertise that DNS is or is not enabled.admin@wf500(active-controller)# set deviceconfig cluster mode controller service-advertisement dns-service enabled yesoradmin@wf500(active-controller)# set deviceconfig cluster mode controller service-advertisement dns-service enabled noBoth commands result in Panorama reporting that the controller nodes are in sync.

INFO: Regardless of the Time Frame you specify for a scheduled custom report on a Panorama M-Series appliance, the earliest possible start date for the report data is effectively the date when you configured the report (MonitorManage Custom Reports).

This issue applies only to scheduled reports; on-demand reports include all data within the specified Time Frame.Workaround: To generate an on-demand report, click Run Now when you configure the custom report.

ISSUE: PAN-225337
INFO:  On the Panorama management server, the configuration push to a multi-vsys firewall fails if you: Create a Shared and vsys-specific device group configuration object with an indentical name. For example, a Shared address object called SharedAO1 and a vsys-specific address object also called SharedAO1.Reference the Shared object in another Shared configuration. For example, reference the Shared address object (SharedAO1) in a Shared address group called SharedAG1.Use the Shared configuration object with the reference in a vsys-specific configuration. For example, reference the Shared address group (SharedAG1) in a vsys-specific policy rule. Workaround: Select PanoramaSetupManagement and edit the Panorama Settings to enable one of the following: Shared Unused Address and Service Objects with DevicesâThis options pushes all Shared objects, along with device group specific objects, to managed firewalls.This is a global setting and applies to all managed firewalls, and may result in pushing too many configuration objects to your managed firewalls.Objects defined in ancestors will take higher precedenceâThis option specifies that in the event of objects with the same name, ancestor object take precedence over descendent objects. In this case, the Shared objects take precedence over the vsys-specific object.This is a global setting and applies to all managed firewalls. In the example above, if the IP address for the Shared SharedAO1 object was 10.1.1.1 and the device group specific SharedAO1 was 10.2.2.2, the 10.1.1.1 IP address takes precedence. Alternatively, you can remove the duplicate address objects from the device group configuration to allow only the Shared objects in your configuration.
