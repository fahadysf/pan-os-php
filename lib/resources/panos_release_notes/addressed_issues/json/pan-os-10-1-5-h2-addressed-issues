The fix is that you can use the following CLI command to change the default tag setting to the tuple setting: admin@firewall> set session lag-flow-key-type ? > tag tag > tuple tuple tag is the default behavior (tag based on the CPU, tuple based on the FE). tuple is the new behavior, where both CPU and FE use the same selection algorithm. Use the following command to display the algorithm: admin@firewall> show session lag-flow-key-type dp0: tuple based on fe100 dp1: tuple based on fe100"
